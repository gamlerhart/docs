# Accessing Local Network

Turbo allows access to the local network in cloud applications launches from the native client. The HTML5 client does not support local network access. Applications launched on the local machine will automatically have local network access.

Click on the Settings link in Turbo Launcher to bring up the settings dialog.

Run an application in the cloud. Local urls are now accessible from the remote application. To access localhost of the local network instead of the remote computer's localhost, use the url **http://localhost.turbo.net**.
