### Troubleshooting

**Cannot use the Control + Click shortcut to right-click on a Mac** 

Some Mac shortcuts, such as Control + Click to right-click, may not work correctly because Windows applications use the same shortcut combination for a different purpose. In this case, Control + Click will add the clicked element to the current selection on a Windows application. To right-click on Turbo for Mac, use a standard mouse right-click or tap with two fingers on the trackpad. 

**Launch fails with dialog "Error The session disconnected unexpectedly: Windows Sockets connect failed".** 

Firewall settings are blocking the required ports or addresses. Ensure that port 443 and 3389 are allowed in your firewall settings. 

**The application does not respond to my clicks when launching in cloud from the Turbo Launcher for Mac.** 

Disable **Use Extended RAIL** under the Turbo Launcher settings (**âš™**).
