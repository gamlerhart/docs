### Troubleshooting

**Turbo for Mac right click command is not working

Turbo for Mac does not translate all possible right click keyboard combinations into the Windows right click. This is because some Windows applications uses those keyboard combinations for a different purpose. Use the standard mouse right click or two finger press on the trackpad on Turbo for Mac.
