## Run Applications

Turbo runs Windows applications in the cloud through multiple end user clients. Turbo also allows users to run the same applications natively on your own personal computer without installing them.

### Dashboard

Use the Dashboard to access your applications. Left click on an application to start it. Right click on an application for advanced options.

To specify the launch behavior click on the settings gear located at the upper right of your dashboard. This setting controls where the application will execute for your left-click launches.

1. **Cloud (Browser)**: the application will execute in the cloud and stream to the user’s device via an HTML5 browser.
2. **Cloud (Windowed)**: the application will execute in the cloud and stream to the user’s device via the Turbo Client. This requires the user to have the Turbo Client installed on a Windows or Mac system.
3. **My Machine**: the application will execute locally on the user’s device. This requires the user to have the Turbo Client installed on a Windows system.
