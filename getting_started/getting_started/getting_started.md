## Getting Started

### Signing In

To get started, sign in to your Turbo.net Portal. The Portal is a web site where you can access all of your organization's applications and files.

Your system administrator will provide with the URL of your organization's Turbo.net Portal. Once you open the URL, you can sign in with your organization credentials.

If you have a Workspace hosted on Turbo.net, press the **Sign In** button in the top right and sign in with your Turbo.net credentials. If you don't already have a Turbo.net account, you will need to [create a Turbo.net account](https://turbo.net/signup) and ask your administrator to add you as a member of the Workspace.

### Native Clients

For the best experience, it is recommended to install the native Turbo.net applications on your device. Turbo.net provides an app for all major desktop and mobile platforms.

If you do not use one of Turbo.net client applications, you can still use Turbo.net via a web browser.

If you are on a device issued by your organization, your system administrator may already have installed the necessary Turbo.net client on your device.
