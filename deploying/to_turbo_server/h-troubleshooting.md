For more information about adding servers refer to <a href="#administration-manage-servers">Managing Servers</a>. After adding a new server verify that you are accessing the site with the specified server web address. If the application still does not launch Turbo Server might be unable to resolve the host name for the external server. To make the host name fully resolvable, add an entry to the <strong>hosts</strong> file on the machine hosting Turbo Server. The host file can be found at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts, and should be in the format: [external server IP address] [external server host name] somename.somecompany.com If the application still does not launch, verify that the security settings for Turbo Server are correctly configured. Improper security settings can restrict access to the Turbo JavaScript API. For more information about how to configure security settings, refer to <a href="#advanced-topics-configure-turboserver-security"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Configuring Turbo Server Security</a></span>.</p>

#### Enable Diagnostic Mode

Enabling diagnostic mode generates debug output logs. These can be used to help the Turbo support staff diagnose and debug issues.

##### Turbo Client

When troubleshooting an issue related to launching applications from the web, Turbo recommends enabling diagnostic mode for the Turbo Client. Complete the following steps to enable diagnostic mode and capture debug output logs for the Turbo Client:

1. Download and run the DebugView application from: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx

2. Run **Regedit.exe**, the Microsoft Windows default registry editor tool.

3. Add the following **String** value to the registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Code Systems\Turbo with the name set to TraceLevel, and the value set to Debug.

4. Restart the Turbo Client by selecting **Start > All Programs > Startup > Turbo Sandbox Manager** ***n.nn***. If multiple versions of the Turbo Sandbox Manager exist, restart each.

5. When the application is launched again with Turbo, the DbgView Output displays debugging logs.

##### Turbo Server

When troubleshooting an issue related to the general administration of Turbo Server, enable diagnostic mode for Turbo Server. Complete the following steps to enable diagnostic mode for Turbo Server:

1. Open a Windows Command Prompt as an administrator (cmd.exe).

2. Enter the following command: **net stop turbo**

3. Navigate to **C:\ProgramData\Turbo Server** and open **settings.xml** with Notepad or another text editor.

4. Add a new element called **TraceLevel** with value **Debug** as a child element to **Settings**; after adding this element the file should resemble the following:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<settings>
		<InstallPath>[Path]</InstallPath>
		<InstalledVersion>[Version]</InstalledVersion>
		<DbLibraryConnection>embedded</DbLibraryConnection>
		<DbManagerConnection>embedded</DbManagerConnection>
		<TraceLevel>Debug</TraceLevel>
	</settings>

5. Enter the following command: **net start turbo**

6. Upon restarting Turbo Server (with the previous command), debug logs are written to a text file located at **C:\Program Files\Turbo Server**. This log file is assigned a name based on the date and time when Turbo Server restarted. A new log file is created on subsequent restarts of Turbo Server.

#### Locating Log Files

There are several types of logs available for Turbo Server, including logs for the installation process, Apache, and SQL Server. The log file locations are dependent on the install location of Turbo Server. The default location is "C:\Program Files\Turbo Server".

**Turbo Server Installation Logs**

- __Install Directory_\logs\Setup.log_

**Turbo Server Runtime Logs**

- __Install Directory_\logs\*.log*_
- __Install Directory_\Sandbox\MODIFIED\@PROGRAMFILESX86@\Turbo Server\Web\logs\*.log_

**Turbo Server Jetty Logs**

- __Install Directory_\Sandbox\roaming\modified\@PROGRAMFILESX86@\Turbo Server\jetty\logs_

**SQL Server Logs (Embedded SQL Server Express)**

- __Install Directory_\Sandbox\MODIFIED\@PROGRAMFILESX86@\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\LOG_

**Apache Logs**

- __Install Directory_\Sandbox\MODIFIED\@PROGRAMFILESX86@\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\logs\error.log_

#### Starting and Stopping the Turbo Server Service

Oftentimes, troubleshooting and fixing problems in Turbo Server requires the Turbo Server service be restarted.

There are currently two ways of doing this, through either the Control Panel or the Command Prompt. Each method is listed, below:

1. Through the **Control Panel**

	a. Navigate to *Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services* or *Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools > Services*

	b. Restart the **Turbo Server** service

2. Via the **Command Prompt** using the **net** command

	a. Run a new command prompt (cmd.exe) as Administrator
	
	b. Type the command net stop turbo to stop the Turbo Server service
	
	The expected output for this command is:
	
		The Turbo Server service is stopping.
		The Turbo Server service was stopped successfully.
		
	c. Type the command net start turbo to start the Turbo Server service

	The expected output for this command is:

		The Turbo Server service is starting.
		The Turbo Server service was started successfully.
		
#### Windows Event Viewer

The Windows Event Viewer is another useful source of information. If there is an issue starting the Windows service for Turbo Server there may be information reported in the Window Event Viewer to help diagnose the problem.
